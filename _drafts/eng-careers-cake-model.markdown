excerpt: How I explain career progression, yearly reviews, promotions, and impact to software engineers

---

I have an model (well...an analogy, really) that I use to explain to software engineers how they should think about the work they do, the impact they have, and how that gets reflected in things such as promotions or bonuses. I explain that career progression is like building a multi-layered cake. Let me explain...

The organisation I work in has several levels (grades) for Software Engineers. These levels, called **career stages**, are used to help define the expectations of the role, and to help guide career progression. The levels include...

- Software Engineer
- Software Engineer II
- Senior Software Engineer
- Principal Software Engineer

... with each one of these career stages building upon the previous. If you're earlier-in-career people start at Software Engineer, and move their way up over time. At least, that's generally how it works.

In addition, each year we have a yearly review process. I won't go into the details of how that works, but the outcome of this process is that an individual's bonus and, potentially, their promotion is decided during this time. The work that an individual has done over the past year, and previous years, along with the **impact** of that work, influences the outcome of this review.

So, as a manager there are some obvious questions that I get asked...

- "What do I need to do to get a promotion?"
- "What do I need to do to get higher rewards?"

... and there are no single answer of formula that results in a promotion or a larger bonus, but I try to explain it like this...(and this is where the cake comes into it)

Each career stage has some expectations associated with it, and for the scope of those expectations changes/expands as you go up the career stages. e.g. you might expect a Software Engineer to design and deliver features, and by the time you get up to Senior or Principal then you'd expect to see them designing and delivering whole systems, or even whole products. Ideally these expectations is written down and shared with everyone. 

The first thing you want to do, as engineer, is understand those expectations for your career stage **and nail them**.
